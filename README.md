# Face Mask Detection

Face Mask Detection is a deep learning model that can detect whether a person is wearing a face mask or not. It utilizes computer vision techniques and deep learning algorithms to classify faces in real-time.

## Features

- Detects face masks in images or video streams.
- High accuracy in identifying the presence or absence of face masks.
- Easy integration into existing projects or systems.

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:

   ```shell
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/face-mask-detection.git
   ```

2. Install the required packages:

   ```shell
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## Usage

### Training

To train your own face mask detection model, follow these steps:

1. Prepare your face mask dataset in the following structure:

   ```
   data/
       with_mask/
           image1.jpg
           image2.jpg
           ...
       without_mask/
           image1.jpg
           image2.jpg
           ...
   ```

2. Run the training script:

   ```shell
   python train.py
   ```

   The trained model will be saved as `mask_detector.model`.

### Face Mask Detection

To detect face masks in images or video streams, use the implementation script:

```shell
python detect_mask.py
```

This will start the face mask detection process and display the results in real-time.
