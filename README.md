# face-mask-detection
The Face Mask Detection code is a deep learning model that can detect whether a person is wearing a face mask or not. It uses the MobileNetV2 architecture and is trained on a dataset of images labeled as "with_mask" or "without_mask". The model is capable of real-time face mask detection on video streams or individual frames.
